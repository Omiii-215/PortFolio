# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a Software Developer and Open Source Enthusiast. It serves as a central hub for my professional identity and a way to connect with others in the industry.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops.
-   **Dark/Light Mode:** Includes a theme toggle allowing users to switch between a sleek dark mode and a crisp light mode.
-   **Smooth Scrolling:** Enhanced navigation experience with smooth scrolling between sections.
-   **Scroll Animations:** Elements fade in and animate as you scroll down the page using the Intersection Observer API.
-   **Dynamic Content:** Auto-updating year in the footer.
-   **Interactive UI:** Hover effects on buttons, project cards, and skill items for a modern look and feel.

## Built With

This project is built using pure, vanilla web technologies to ensure high performance and full control over the design:

-   **HTML5:** Semantic markup for accessibility and structure.
-   **CSS3:** Custom styling using CSS Variables, Flexbox, and CSS Grid. No external CSS frameworks were used (except for Font Awesome icons).
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic (theme toggle, mobile menu, observers).
-   **Font Awesome:** For icons used in the social links and UI elements.
